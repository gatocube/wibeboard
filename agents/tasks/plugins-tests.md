We should have have a test for our helloworld plugin.  We should test when we switch the plugin on-off we reactivetly display plugin ui. On plugin settings page we should have an option to see the plugin "mdx" file

plugin manifest should have a setting for permissions. We support only one permission that allows to read secrets. If plugin has this permission, then we should display a badge in plugin settings page.
