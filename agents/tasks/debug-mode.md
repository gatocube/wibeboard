Our nodes should have a debug mode. In this mode we display different things in different sizes.

For compact mode we show only node id and type.

For normal mode we show a json of state

For big mode we display the full node json and have a CanvasView with all events for that node.

We should be able to switch nodes in debug mode in our widgets gallery
