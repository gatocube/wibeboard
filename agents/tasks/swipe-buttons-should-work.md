If we attach SwipeButtons menu to any elements and we have swipe mode enabled, then the swipe should works since user touched the element with attached menu. Right now it works only from first menu button.

The same situation for hold mode - I should hold the element with attached menu to open the menu. Right now it works only from first menu button.
